# This information was taken mainly from the schematic of the base board
# which you may find in [this link](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/u4TGjVyMPjTvswf/download?path=%2FBaseBoard&files=R4T_tpix.pdf).
# For the `LSB` of the I2C slave address, see [the datasheet](https://www.mouser.ch/datasheet/2/256/MAX5823-MAX5825-1515715.pdf#page=17).
# For the `MSB` I am not sure where it is defined to be `1`, but it works.
